###strengths
1. High Adaptability to future changes
1. The structure is quite clear and developers with relational background will understand it easily
1. High customisable queries according to the needs
1. Ready for deal with different fields for "section"


###weaknesses
1. Ensure validations/integrity between different relationships levels will have high complexity
2. In some situations complex queries will be needed to be made to retrieve data from relationships
3. Looks like in future some entities responsible for grouping data from different collections will be needed


###Overview
1. I've made a decision about a tradeoff for this system, I choose to have a easy understanding and high customizability, but high complexity on queries.
